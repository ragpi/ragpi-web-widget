# Ragpi Web Widget Integration

Ragpi's Web Widget integration allows you to embed a chat widget on your website, enabling users to ask questions and receive AI-assisted answers directly from your knowledge base. It uses a simple JavaScript script to load the widget, which is protected by google recaptcha v3 to prevent spam and abuse. The widget will connect to the Ragpi API through a lightweight API gateway that will verify the recaptcha token and forward the request to the Ragpi API. This ensures that only valid requests are processed, and it helps to protect your API key from being exposed in the client-side code.

Check out the [Ragpi Web Widget integration documentation](https://docs.ragpi.io/integrations/web-widget) to learn more about how to set up and use the integration.
